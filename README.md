### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

If you reached this profile this probably happened by mistake as I'm not as active I'd like tobe around here.
Anyway, you may want to know I worked for many years with PHP and JEE but now retired from professional programming, I'm speding my conding skills with R and Python, with special interest in statistics and AI/ML.

Cheers
